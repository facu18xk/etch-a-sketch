# Etch-a-Sketch Project

Welcome to my Etch-a-Sketch project! This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, aimed at improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The live preview of this project can be found [here](https://facu18xk.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic Etch-a-Sketch application with the following features:

1. A 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. The grid is created using JavaScript, organized within a container div.
3. Flexbox is used to arrange the divs in a grid layout.
4. Hover effect: Divs change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail.
5. User can input the number of squares per side through a button, generating a new grid.
   - The user input is limited to a maximum of 100 squares to prevent resource issues.
6. Extra Credit:
   - RGB value randomization on each interaction.
   - Progressive darkening effect: Each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square.
